I am a postdoc at RWTH Aachen and KIT in Germany, previously I completed my PhD at The University of Sydney working on cosmology and astroparticle physics.

I use cosmology to investigate the nature of dark matter through the use of linear and nonlinear numerical tools. In particular, I have worked on constraining interactions between dark matter and neutrinos, using existing CMB data as well as forecasts for future 21cm observations and gravitational waves.

I am interested in using numerical tools to help us investigate the nature of our universe, in conjunction with novel cosmological and astrophysical observations.

In Sydney, I was part of the [Astroparticle Group](https://astroparticle-science.sydney.edu.au/), as well as the [Arc Centre of Excellence for Dark Matter Particle Physics](https://www.centredarkmatter.org/).

Finally, if you think my research sounds interesting and you would like to hear more, or have an idea that you want to collaborate on, please get in touch!
